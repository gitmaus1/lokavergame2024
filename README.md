Summary
	Sum up your game idea in 2 sentences. A kind of elevator pitch. Keep it simple!
Gameplay
	What should the gameplay be like? What is the goal of the game, and what kind of obstacles are in the way? What tactics should the player use to overcome them?
Mindset
	What kind of mindset do you want to provoke in the player? Do you want them to feel powerful, or weak? Adventurous, or nervous? Hurried, or calm? How do you intend to provoke those emotions?
